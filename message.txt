The farthest distance in the world

Is not the distance between life and death
But you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you

The farthest distance in the world

Is not you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you

But I cannot say I love you when I love you so madly

The farthest distance in the world

Is not I cannot say I love you when I love you so madly

But I can only bury it in my heart dispite the unbearable yearning

The farthest distance in the world

Is not I can only bury it in my heart dispite the unbearable yearning

But we cannot be together when we love each other

The farthest distance in the world

Is not we cannot be together when we love each other

But we pretend caring nothing even we know love is unconquerable

The farthest distance in the world

Is not the distance between two trees

But the branches cannot depend on each other in wind even they grow from the same root

The farthest distance in the world

Is not the braches cannot depend on each other

But two stars cannot meet even they watch each other

The farthest distance in the world

Is not the track between two stars

But nowhere to search in a tick after two tracks join

The farthest distance in the world

Is not nowhere to search in a tick

But doomed not to be together before they meet

The farthest distance in the world

Is the distance between fish and bird
